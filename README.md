2. Case Density Animation on World Map (Time Laps)
3. Cases over the time with area plot
4. Folium Maps
5. Confirmed Cases with Choropleth Map
6. Death and Recovered per 100 cases
7. Confirmed and Death cases with static colormap
8. New Cases and Number of Countries 
9. Top 15 Countries Case Analysis
10. Confirmed,Deaths, New Cases VS Country and Time Bar Plots
11. Confirmed,Deaths, New Cases VS Country and Time Line Plots
12. Tree Map Analysis
